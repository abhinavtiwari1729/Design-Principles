// Itâ€™s the ability to replace any object of a parent class with any object of one of its child classes without affecting the correctness of the program.

// Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it.

// Above scenerio violate LSP we can work it out by changing class structure as below :-
